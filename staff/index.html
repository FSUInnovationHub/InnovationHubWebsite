            <h4>[1.b] Overview</h4>
            <p>The Innovation Hub transcends the traditional, discipline-based organizational structure of universities by providing a central location, or hub, where students, faculty, and staff from all departments can collaborate and innovate.</p>
            <p>The Hub provides students with access to collaborative workspace and the latest technologies. Innovation Hub staff and our <a href="https://innovation.fsu.edu/#partners">Partner Departments</a> provide training in Design Thinking, 3D and 2D Design, Virtual and Augmented Reality, 3D Printing, Laser Cutting, Circuitry, Coding, Web Design and Development, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Data Science and Analytics, App Development, Unmanned Aerial Systems, and much, much more. In addition to classes, workshops, and presentations, the Innovation Hub hosts meet-ups, hackathons, innovention weekends, design sprints, technology showcases, shark tanks, and other fun and engaging events.</p>

            <h4>[1.c] Design Thinking</h4>
            <p>Design Thinking is the core innovation framework used to spark innovation @ The Hub. Design Thinking, sometimes referred to as Human Centered Design (see video below), is an innovation framework for interdisciplinary groups, rooted in empathy for an issue or opportunity, strongly dependant on the benefits of diverse perspectives, with specially designed methods and tools for ideation, prototyping, and testing. </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:80px"><img class="img-fluid" src="../images/dt2.png" alt="design thinking diagram"></p>
            <p>Depending on who you ask, Design Thinking has three to five stages. The process is essentially the same across all definitions, but the names of the stages vary slightly:</p>
