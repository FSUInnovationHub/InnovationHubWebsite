# InnovationHubWebsite

2018' Innovation Hub Website

## Editing the Site

The site has some automations and features added on top of normal git.

### [`git-lfs`]

In order to manage all of the large files on the website, we use [`git-lfs`]which must be installed on your computer in order to contribute to the website.

Once [`git-lfs`] has been installed, clone the repository with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/FSUInnovationHub/InnovationHubWebsite.git
$ cd InnovationHubWebsite
$ git lfs get
```

It should not be necessary to run `git lfs get`, but do so if you happen to notice that image files and other large files are empty or corrupted.
